Create a GitHub action on one of your GitHub repositories. Make sure one of the steps in the action has a name that contains your email address 22f3002165@ds.study.iitm.ac.in. For example:


jobs:
  test:
    steps:
      - name: 22f3002165@ds.study.iitm.ac.in
        run: echo "Hello, world!"
      
Trigger the action and make sure it is the most recent action.

What is your repository URL? It will look like: https://github.com/USER/REPO
